```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Read my portfolio table.

```{r cars}
library(stockr)
mystock.file <- system.file("extdata", "fred.csv", package = "stockr")
st <- stockr::StockTable(mystock.file)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
